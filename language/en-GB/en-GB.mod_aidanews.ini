UPDATE_SUCCESS=<div><h1>AiDaNews Module v 1.0</h1><p align="center"><img src="../modules/mod_aidanews/logo.png" border="0" alt="Logo" /></p><br/> AiDaNews is a Latest News module completely integrated with <a href="http://www.flexicontent.org/" title="Get FLEXIcontent!">FLEXIcontent</a>. Anyway, the module will detect if FLEXIcontent has been installed on your site or not and show you the options that suit your needs.<br /> The AiDaNews Module has been created with flexibility in mind: not only it will let you choose <b>what</b> you want to display, but also <b>how</b> to display it! This thanks to custom styling options that can be changed directly from the backend of the module, with no need to actually turn your FTP client on and manually change CSS files.<br />Anything, from items ordering method to article image position, can be easily set from the backend. Don't think this great number of options will lead you to confusion, though! Thanks to explanatory descriptions and the accordion-like sorting method, finding the option you need will be quick and easy!<br/><br/>Full Changelog <a href="../modules/mod_aidanews/Changelog.txt">HERE</a> - FAQs <a href="../modules/mod_aidanews/How_To.txt">HERE</a> - Module's structure <a href="../modules/mod_aidanews/aidanewsstructure.jpg">HERE</a> - Date format Help <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php">HERE</a><br/>Get new versions, submit feature requests and ask fixes for bugs <a href="http://www.aimini.it">HERE</a>.<br/>Feel free to send me an e-mail (dan@cdh.it) [Write in English or Italian please!] to show me your website where AiDaNews have been used, to request support or for any other need.
