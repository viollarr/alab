New in 1.0.1

	* Bugfix: Introtexts couldn't be shortened by number of keys (Now it works again)
	* Bugfix: Random variable errors if FLEXIcontent was not installed (Corrected)

New in 1.0

	* The old code coming from the previous module has been rewritten of cleaned
	* Categories are now selected using a special menu. It doesn't recognise FLEXIcontent's nested categories, but it's much easier to use than adding catids manually
	-> The category menu has been taken from the module mod_lofarticlesslideshow. Get it here: http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/news-display/articles-showcase/11309
	* You can now choose NOT to display articles coming from selected categories (using the same new menu as above)
	* Module Class Suffix - tell me if it works properly
	* A new CSS fields lets you input the links' style in the module. This feature works properly, but adds the CSS in the head of the page multiple times for multiple modules - all the modules will share this setting even if you only wrote something in one module, unless you used a module class suffix
	* The '...' at the end of shortened titles and intros can now be customised
	* The module is now W3C validated
	* Fixed [addcomments] (didn't work)
	* Category Inclusion/Exclusion rewritten - it can handle multiple categories correctly, as well as FLEXIcontent secondary categories (E.G. it will take all the articles selected with "Limit to Category" and remove from these ones the ones also belonging to a category that has been selected in the "Exclude Categories" list. The module also supports the "Uncategorized" articles, but they will only be displayed if they're the only selected category.
	
Name Changed to AiDaNews

New in 2.5.5:

	* Date can now be shown with a custom value
	* Bugfix: "Limit author to" field only works with logged in users
	* New "Limit Author" option: Limit to news written by my JomSocial friends
	* You can now show the author's JomSocial avatar as the article's image
	* New Intro options: show article's introtext (default) or fulltext, strip {plugin tags} and start from the first <p> tag occurrence
	* Some fixes in the code to make it lighter: avoided two database queries that were useless
	* Bugfix: Undefined variable errors showing up when some elements weren't displayed
	* A link similar to "Readmore", named "Add Comments", can now be shown wherever you need using the tag [addcomments]. It takes the user to the news, or specifically to the comments form if you're using jcomments
	* Bigfix: Every article got redundant divs around every position based on their location (article #1 had 1 div, article #12 had 12 divs... @_@). This has been corrected
	* FLEXIcontent fields can now be displayed everywhere in the module! They still share the same CSS and need the label to be displayed, but this will be arranged in the next version. The 'Flexi' position will only be available if FLEXIcontent has been installed on the site.

New in 2.5.4:

	* The code that manages images display has been adjusted a bit. The option that allows FLEXIcontent images to be shown has been changed: selecting "FLEXI image fiels - First Image" you'll be shown the image from the field you selected, or (if there's none) the first image displayed in that article or (if there's none) the default image. The other option keeps on displaying the FLEXIcontent image or the default one.
	* Show Category's image - four new options have been added in the "Image to Display" menu. Remember that the first image in the option will be shown if present, and if it isn't present other images will be shown in order. The last one is always the default one, so you'd better choose a default image!
	* You can now show User CB Avatar instead of the article's image
	* The title can now be shown with no link on it

New in 2.5.3b:

	* Bugfix: JomSocial and JSocialSuite support were coded in the right way but mistied in the backend. All links should now work correctly
    * Support for JomComment added - remember you have to add the tag [comments] in the Layout Setup!
    * Some French language strings added for the backend
    * Removed a couple of default values in the module's backend, as they kept getting back if the field was left blank

New in 2.5.3:

	* Bugfix: Date didn't display properly if FLEXicontent wasn't installed on the site - the issue has now been corrected
	* Output is now formed mainly by functions - this helps the ordering feature (see below)
	* $moduleclass_sfx removed, as it didn't offer anything more than the other CSS options
	* Advanced templating: just write the TAG corresponding to what you want to be shown to get it! This allows free ordering and positioning. See the template in the module's description for more info.
	* Backend Tabs ordered again - This ordering should be final
	* Show Frontpage articles only / Hide Frontpage articles / Show both Normal and Frontpage articles option corrected (it was incomplete and didn't work properly)

New in 2.5.2:

	* You can now link the article's author to their CB/JomSocial/JSocialSuite profile. I couldn't test it with JomSocial and JSocialSuite as I haven't bought any of them - let me know if the links work!
	* New options to limit the output: Written by me, Not written by me, Written by Friends (only CB is supported ATM - if you own JomSocial or JSocialSuite and want this option added, help me letting me see the tables structure and names)
	* Article and More Articles links can now be directed to a new window/tab (target: _blank)

New in 2.5.1:

	* Rating average will be rounded to the nearest integer. A toggle also allows you to decide how to approximate the number (1 / 1,2 / 1,23)
	* Bugfix: module looking for a FLEXIcontent table when date is activated, even if the flexi_date option wasn't active or FLEXIcontent wasn't installed on the site

New in 2.5:

	* The module can now be used as a Related News module! You can use metakeys with jos_content, and choose between metakeys and TAGs in FLEXIcontent!
	* FLEXIcontent URLs support added (Beta): selecting this option, the module will feature the same URLs as FLEXIcontent. It gave some errors to me, get back to Standard if it does to you too
	* Bugfix: a couple of "Undefined Variable" errors that showed up if hits and rating weren't shown have been corrected
	* Module now fully supports PHP 5.3 (A couple of deprecated strings have been rewritten) (Thx newbieinprogress)
	* Backend has been rearranged - Options are now easier to find	
	* Added language files support: this allows the module to change its output following the site's language when using JoomFISH. Pretty useless otherwise, as all the elements in the Language file are actually in the module's backend too
	* You can now choose to display articles of a specified language, whatever the current one is
	* A field to set grid column width can now be found
	* A message will show up if no article matching the limitations set has been found	

New in 2.4.3d:

	* Bugfix: no image field results in error notices sometimes - I should have solved it, but if it happens again a message will help the user to solve the problem this time
	* Bugfix: ";" was shown in the introtext replacing the <br /> tag. This option was deleted from the corresponding function
	
New in v 2.4.3c:

    * Bugfix: corrected Webee Comments" table

New in v 2.4.3b:

    * Bugfix: a blank row appeared in some cases when using the grid layout
    * Bugfix: corrected a bug that prevented the module from being used when FLEXIcontent wasn't installed on the site
    * Added possibility of not displaying "clear:both" in the article's main style (displayed by default - I recommend keeping it there, but you may need to remove it...)

New in v 2.4.3

	* JoomFish support added - module will only show news in the current language if the option is set to yes
	* Grid Layout - turn it on, select number of columns and you're ready to go! (PLEASE NOTE: this option uses tables, but they only appear if you turn this option on)
	* Bugfix: corrected a little mistake that prevented the module from being used if FLEXIcontent wasn't installed on the site (OPS!)

New in v 2.4.2

	* You can upgrade the module by installing it on any previous version, without first uninstalling it. This will make it keep all the previous settings, with no need of rewriting them from the ground-up every time
	* Possibility of writing different Rating and Hits title for singular and plural and automatic detection of when to apply them. (Example: 1 -> vote, 72 -> votes)
	* SEF urls can be toggled from the backend (The new URLs introduced in v 2.4.1 caused conflicts with some external SEF components. Disabling this option you should be able to use your favourite component again)
	* You can now insert a custom path to retrieve FLEXIcontent's image fields images from.
	* Comment systems support - you can now choose to display comments number next to the article's hits and rating. Some Comment Systems I found on the JED are supported, but virtually any comment system can be used with the custom option. An X will be displayed instead of the number of comments if the infos you provided are wrong, or if you select a Commenting System you haven't installed on your site.
	* Bugfix - a little coding mistake
	* Logo image is now smaller and quicker to load
	
New in v 2.4.1

	* Article alias and category alias shown in link (SEF urls)
	* Possibility of excluding first X articles that would be displayed using the ordering condition you selected. Useful if you don't want to show an article that is already being shown in another module, or if you want to show more instances of the module in a column with different display options
	* You can now display the bottom fields (hits and rating) on the top, next to the title. This will help creating a no-image listing. They will hinerit the CSS attributes you gave to the top section
	* You can now decide wheter to display the image for Rating and Hits or not. If the image isn't displayed, the title you gave to it will be shown if present
	* You can now choose to add a prefix to Rating and Hits, no matter the position they are displayed in.
	* Choose what date to display between 4 alternatives. "Unpublished" is useful when using the "Upcoming Events" ordering method.
	* "Upcoming Events" ordering method debugged and adjusted. More infos about it can be found in the tooltips.

New in v 2.4

	* Section IDs field will disappear if FLEXIcontent is detected on the site

	* Decide wether to display Rating sum or average
	* Images can be displayed in alternate position (1: left, 2: right, 3: left and so on)
	* "Read More" text can be followed by article title to obtain something like "Keep on reading (article title)". The title will be shortened based on title's shorten option
	* Up to 6 custom text fields can be displayed. You can choose how to arrange them (1 or 2 columns), wheter to display them under the image or next to it (useful in some cases) and style the fields' output, the labels and the box containing them from the backend
	* Bugfix: Articles no longer overlay when an image and no body is selected in tableless mode. There's no motivation to keep the "Tableless output" option on, so it has been removed. The output uses no tables
	* Added separators for different elements in the backend

New in v 2.3.2

    * The module will check if FLEXIcontent has been installed on the site and display FLEXIcontent specific options if it's the case.
